Developed an Interactive Dashboard for Food & Beverage Services (Opportunity Analysis for a Leading Food and Beverage Manufacturer)

## Project Ojbective
Our client, the Sales Director of a leading Food and Beverage Manufacturer, has requested a report that provides both hindsight and insight into his business using the provided datasets. Additionally, he is looking for the creation of an interactive dashboard to explore and analyze sales opportunities in non-commercial areas and adjacent retail locations, with the goal of expanding his F&B services.

## Case Statement
Shaun is a Sales Director, Food Services Division at a major Food & Beverages Manufacturer. He has just been promoted into his role for top notch sales performance as well his keen analytic aptitude. 

True to his nature, he’s constantly on the lookout for newer sources of data to drive business (other than the sales data that comes from internal systems). In a review with his team, he landed on what he thought was right in this space (see attached a sample of this). The spreadsheet has 3 tabs, that have the following:

1)	Total spend of his customers (restaurants) across various F&B categories, along with % share of purchases from Shaun’s company
2)	Data about non-commercial establishments such as hospitals, schools across different geographic areas.
3)	Retail outlets spread across similar geographies.

Shaun would like to use this to perform an “Opportunities Analysis”. He has an annual conference coming up in less than a week to prepare for, but wanted to get this started without delay. 

He jotted down a few bullets to convey what he has in mind as the charter for the analysis.

-	Get a quick view of share of total spends and F&B spends for existing customers (restaurants)
-	What are the adjacent opportunities from the non-commercial establishments to additionally sell into (note that there are no customers currently in the non-commercial segment)
-	Retailers is a different business division and hence out of scope for me (Shaun), but some of my customers / prospects could be buying from these retailers – so getting a view of retailer presence adjacent to his customers & prospects will help understand how much of these opportunities are being met / unmet.
-	I would like the analyses to be simple, intuitive as well as give me a picture at different levels of geographic granularity as well as by different business segments. In short, “it should the tell a story around where are our biggest opportunities”
